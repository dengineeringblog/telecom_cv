  From the jungles of Suriname to sites all over the UK, I get the job done, properly and safely. 
  
  My commitment is simple: <mark>DELIVER RESULTS</mark>. 
  
  Iâ€™m ready for new challenges and to keep growing by putting my experience into action.

          Hands-on experience in the <mark>installation</mark>, <mark>alignment</mark>, and <mark>troubleshooting</mark> of point-to-point microwave links. Iâ€™ve worked with a wide range of antenna sizes, including dishes up to 3.2 meters in diameter, often in remote environments and at heights above 100 meters.
          
          In Suriname, I was responsible for deploying and aligning microwave links in the jungle, often under challenging conditions.
          Iâ€™ve also collaborated in performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y.1564">Y.1564 test</a>.

          Besides fieldwork, Iâ€™ve shared some of my experience through <a href="https://dengineeringblog.github.io/ascend/">technical articles</a> about microwave systems, a way to give back to the community and keep learning myself.

          I donâ€™t believe leadership is about titles, itâ€™s about taking <mark>responsibility</mark> and delivering <mark>results</mark>. Iâ€™ve led multi-country field teams, under pressure and in tough environments.

          When Iâ€™m in charge, the job gets done: **properly executed**. Thatâ€™s is the standard. 

          My approach is simple: *lead by example*, *communicate clearly*, *keep safety first*, and *make sure the team knows they can count on me*.

          Iâ€™ve spent years working at height, in Suriname, where sites are deep in the jungle with difficult access and hostile conditions, with towers up to 200 meters of height. and across the UK.

          As a Senior Rigger, Iâ€™ve carried out <mark>full telecom installations</mark>, <mark>upgrades</mark>, and <mark>equipment swaps</mark>. Iâ€™ve worked with equipment from <mark>Huawei</mark>, <mark>Nokia</mark>, <mark>Ericsson</mark>, and others, handling both the **rigging** and **technical side** of installations.

          Iâ€™ve worked as an RF Test Engineer, performing both **stationary** and **mobility** testing for <mark>GSM</mark>, <mark>UMTS</mark>, and <mark>LTE</mark> networks. During projects with Digicel and Telesur in Suriname (2020â€“2022), I helped **map signal coverage**, **benchmark performance**, and **optimize the network**.

          This role gave me a deep understanding of how mobile networks work, from user experience to cell site behavior. 

          Through this experience, I developed strong knowledge of key network parameters, and also understand the why behind the numbers.

          Over the years, Iâ€™ve solved <mark>Layer 1 issues</mark> such as:

          - Microwave link misalignment, including cases where the installation was poorly executed. My team has successfully completed installations that other teams couldnâ€™t finish, and weâ€™ve also troubleshooted issues caused by mistakes during their installation work.

          - Faulty feeders, jumpers, or connectors causing signal loss. Iâ€™ve diagnosed and documented these issues in my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s7nTFxnWGjPIEsbrzFRyQPrRSji4fYp1/view?usp=sharing">technical reports</a>.
          In some cases, Iâ€™ve supported my company by providing evidence during VSWR investigations, showing that the root cause was in legacy infrastructure, not in the installation carried out by my company.


          These hands-on experiences have helped me quickly identify root causes and apply practical solutions on site.

          Hands-on experience conducting both <mark>pre-build</mark> surveys for microwave deployments and <mark>infrastructure</mark> surveys to assess site structural conditions.

          My work includes:

          - Line-of-sight (LOS) surveys to validate clear paths for point-to-point microwave links.

          - Pre-build site assessments to plan equipment layout, cable routing, and mounting points.

          - Tower and rooftop infrastructure surveys to check structural integrity, grounding systems, and available space.

          Iâ€™m not the person who collects certificates just to show them off, I believe in practical, hands-on skills that make a real difference in the field.

          That said, Iâ€™ve been doing the *"homework"*, expanding my technical knowledge. That includes multiple certifications from **Anritsu**: <mark> RF Fundamentals</mark>  - <mark> Radio Frequency: Module 1</mark>  - <mark> Decibels: Module 2</mark>  - <mark> Modulation: Module 3</mark>  - <mark> RF Impairment: Module 4</mark>  - <mark> Antennas: Module 5</mark>  - <mark> Coaxial Cables: Module 6</mark>  - <mark> Components: Module 7</mark>  - <mark> Propagation: Module 8</mark>  - <mark> Microwave: Module 9</mark>, <mark> Waveguide Line Sweeping </mark>,

          Automation Engineering is often misunderstood as related to automotive technology; however, it is a discipline focused on industrial automation, control systems, 
          and process optimization across a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure.

          Throughout my 5 years career path, I developed a strong foundation in  technical areas that are highly transferable to other engineering domains.
          Key areas of study included: <mark> Electronics </mark>, <mark>Industrial Instrumentation & Measurement </mark>, <mark> SCADA Systems </mark>(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), <mark> PLC Programming </mark>, <mark> Programming </mark>(in general).
